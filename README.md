Azure Arc enables you to manage your entire environment, with a single pane of glass, by projecting your existing non-Azure, on-premises, or other-cloud resources into Azure Resource Manager. The first step is to onboard your on-premises servers into Azure Arc. Once your on-premises servers are onboarded, you can benefit from native Azure services like Azure Policy, Azure Monitor, and Azure Automation. This project helps you on deploying a Minimum Valuable Product (MVP) of these Azure Services.
